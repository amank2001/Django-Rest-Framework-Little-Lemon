I have created an django rest framework application which is commonly used for authentication and authorization purpose of you web application and also for browsable API interface.
Here you can browse through the webpages with the help of API endpoints writing in the url box.
I'm providing with some urls which you can browse through:-
menu/
menu/<int:pk> (<int:pk> = 1,2,3,4,5 to view the particular item in the menu list) 
restaurant1/bookings/
auth/
These are also present in app level and project level urls.py
You can also test these API urls in applications such as Insomnia and Postman if you have knowledge about it.
